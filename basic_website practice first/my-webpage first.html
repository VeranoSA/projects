      <p class="p1">Paris has been voted the most beautiful city in the world<br>
      in a new ranking. Travel website Flight Network compiled the<br>
      list of 50 cities by surveying more than 1,000 travel writers <br>
      and agencies around the world. The French capital came top, followed<br>
      by New York in second place and London in third.The city drips magic<br>
      and romance from every corner of its streets to the highest steeples of<br>
      its many cathedrals. Visiting Paris is truly an experience that will make<br>
      you a dreamer of idealistic thoughts, even if just for a little bit.<br>
      This is one place that i would love to be.</p>
